Things to do

1. Compute pipeline state has a bool in it
2. Textures have a few extra options
3. Metal Editor has no concept of sampler states
4. Cannot set threadgroup memory length for compute shaders
5. Metal Editor does not support rendering to textures (or the entire MTLRenderPassDescriptor class)
6. There are all sorts of state pointers you can set before a render invocation. There are a lot of variables here.
7. Metal Editor does not support indexed draws or instancing
8. Inspect shader arguments to create sliders
9. All single-column table views should migrate to stack views
10. Int text view delegates don't work with table views
11. Metal asserts all over the place under the covers
