Differences between Metal and Metal Editor:

1. Compute pipeline state has a bool in it
2. Textures have a few extra options
3. Metal Editor has no concept of sampler states
4. Cannot set threadgroup memory length for compute shaders
5. Metal Editor does not support rendering to textures (or the entire MTLRenderPassDescriptor class)
6. There are all sorts of state pointers you can set before a render invocation. There are a lot of variables here.
7. Metal Editor does not support indexed draws or instancing
8. Inspect shader arguments to create sliders

Metal asserts all over the place under the covers
