Things to do

1. Compute pipeline state has a bool in it
2. Textures have a few extra options
3. Metal Editor has no concept of sampler states
4. Cannot set threadgroup memory length for compute shaders
5. Metal Editor does not support indexed draws or instancing
6. Create more different kinds of sliders
7. All single-column table views should migrate to stack views
8. Int text view delegates don't work with table views

Metal assertions:
1. MTLCommandBuffer.renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor() asserts if there are no textures set.
2. MTLRenderCommandEncoder.setRenderPipelineState() asserts if any of the color attachments have non-invalid pixel format if there is no texture set for that color attachment.
3. MTLDevice.newRenderPipelineStateWithDescriptor() asserts if there were no valid pixelformats set.

MTLRenderPipelineReflection doesn't give you return types
