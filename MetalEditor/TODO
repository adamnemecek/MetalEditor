Things to do

1. Compute pipeline state has a bool in it
2. Textures have a few extra options
3. Metal Editor has no concept of sampler states
4. Cannot set threadgroup memory length for compute shaders
5. Metal Editor does not support rendering to textures (or the entire MTLRenderPassDescriptor class)
7. Metal Editor does not support indexed draws or instancing
8. Inspect shader arguments to create sliders
9. All single-column table views should migrate to stack views
10. Int text view delegates don't work with table views

Metal assertions:
1. MTLCommandBuffer.renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor() asserts if there are no textures set.
