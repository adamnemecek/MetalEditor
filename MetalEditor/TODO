Things to do

1. Compute pipeline state has a bool in it
2. Textures have a few extra options
3. Metal Editor has no concept of sampler states
4. Cannot set threadgroup memory length for compute shaders
5. Metal Editor does not support indexed draws or instancing
6. Create more different kinds of sliders
7. All single-column table views should migrate to stack views
8. Create a design for texture arrays
9. Focusing text fields causes file to be edited
10. Make sure that vertexBufferLayouts' indices and vertexAttribute's indices are unique
11. There are a whole bunch of textfield delegates which need to be set
12. RenderPipelineState doesn't resize correctly
13. Should try some way to save slider state

Metal assertions:
1. MTLCommandBuffer.renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor() asserts if there are no textures set.
2. MTLRenderCommandEncoder.setRenderPipelineState() asserts if any of the color attachments have non-invalid pixel format if there is no texture set for that color attachment.
3. MTLDevice.newRenderPipelineStateWithDescriptor() asserts if there were no valid pixelformats set.
4. If you have an extra MTLVertexBufferLayoutDescriptor which is unreferenced inside the render state
5. If you don't have a MTLVertexBufferLayoutDescriptor for every buffer which is referenced by a MTLVertexAttributeDescriptor
6. MTLKit can't seem to open .pngs

Crash when attribute buffer indices straddle a uniform buffer index
MTLRenderPipelineReflection doesn't give you return types
